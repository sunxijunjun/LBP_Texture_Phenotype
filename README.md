# Vertebral Texture & Phenotype Analysis Report

---
## 0. Data Cleaning
- The data consisted of dichotomous, ordered categorical, and continuous variables, which were first distinguished.

## 1. Texture Feature Classification

- Data source: combined_texture_data_reordered.xlsx
- Model: Random Forest
- Target: folder_index
- Result: overall accuracy 0.85, see confusion matrix below
- TODO: This random forest model is built using features extracted from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Feature selection and importance evaluation are currently in progress to assess the model's performance and enhance its interpretability.

## 2. Phenotype Statistical Test

- Data source: GSTAT_Univariate.xlsx 
- Statistical methods: Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, Fisher's Exact
- See table below for significant associations.

## 3. Phenotype Univariate logistic regression
- Data source: GSTAT_Univariate.xlsx
- Statistical methods: univariate logistic regression for continuous_vars + dichotomous_vars, and ordinal logistic regression for ordinal vars.
### Univariate logistic regression results for continuous_vars + dichotomous_vars:

### Ordinal logistic regression (ORL) for ordinal vars:
- Prior to constructing the OLR model, all variables were evaluated for compliance with the modelâ€™s assumptions. All variables met the prerequisites.
- Results:

## 4. Phenotype Multivariate logistic regression
- Data source: GSTAT_Univariate.xlsx, Selected 7 * (dichotomous + continuous) variables with p < 0.2: ['Height', 'Weight', 'BMI', 'Education', 'Marital_status_LBP_Baseline', 'HIZ_L3_4', 'Facet_tropism_L5_S1'] ; as well as 9 * ordinal bin vars (ordinal converted to binary).
- VIF:

### DELETED high VIF feature Heigh and Weight, kept BMI, rechecked VIF and collinearity

### Multivariate logistic regression (MLR), standardized continuous_vars using z-score.
- After multiple rounds of feature selection and model fitting, the following set of vars was finalized for MLR. The figure below illustrates their intercorrelations.
